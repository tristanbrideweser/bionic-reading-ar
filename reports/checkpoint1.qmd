Accelerated Reading via Bionic AR Glasses

## Part 1: Project Context

### Problem Statement & Goal
**Problem Statement:**  
- Bionic reading is a technique that boldens certain parts of text to adjust focus to increase reading speed. 
- However, while usable for many digital outlets, it is not widely available in print media, and if it is, new media must be purchased.

**Goal / Hypothesis:**  
- This project seeks to design a device that leverages smart glasses to detect and "bionify" text and overlay onto existing print media utilizing augmented reality (AR).

### Methodology Overview
**Approach:**  
The following project structure will be implemented:
- OCR
- Bionification
- Output

**Key Components:**  
- Bullet 1: [e.g., OCR pipeline for scanned books]  
- Bullet 2: [e.g., Text preprocessing with OpenCV + Tesseract]  
- Bullet 3: [e.g., Prototype Bionic Reading interface]
